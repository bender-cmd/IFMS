## âœ…Key Tables Explanation

    FUND: Stores index fund metadata (name, description, total capital)

    ASSET: Master list of all crypto assets with current prices

    FUND_ASSET: Junction table linking funds to their constituent assets with target percentages

    REBALANCE_LOG: Tracks each rebalancing event

    REBALANCE_DETAIL: Records specific changes needed for each asset in a rebalance

## ðŸš€ Detailed Event Flow:

1. **Scheduler Trigger**

        Cron job triggers based on schedule (e.g., daily at market close)
    
        Identifies funds due for rebalancing (could be all or based on custom schedules)

2. **Fetch Fund Data**

       Retrieve all active funds and their target allocations from FUND and FUND_ASSET tables

3. **Price Data Collection**

       Fetch current market prices for all constituent assets from price feed API

       Verify prices are fresh (within last X minutes)

4. **Rebalance Calculation**


       For each fund:

          a. Calculate current allocations based on latest prices
          b. Compare against target allocations
          c. Determine if rebalance threshold is met (e.g., any asset >Â±5% from target)
          d. Calculate required trades to return to target allocations

5. **Pre-Execution Logging**

       Store proposed rebalance actions in REBALANCE_LOG and REBALANCE_DETAIL

       Mark status as "calculated"

6. **Trade Execution**

       For funds needing rebalance:
          a. Execute trades through exchange API
          b. Implement safeguards (price slippage limits, minimum trade sizes)
          c. Handle partial fills gracefully

7. **Post-Execution Updates**

       Record actual executed prices and quantities
   
       Update fund's base currency balance
   
       Mark rebalance as "completed" or "failed" with reason

8. **Reporting**

       Generate rebalance confirmation for fund managers

       Update dashboards with new allocations

       Record performance metrics

9. **Cleanup**

       Archive old rebalance records per retention policy
    
       Trigger alerts for any failures requiring manual intervention

## ðŸŒŸ Key Considerations:

- Threshold Checking: Only rebalance when allocations drift beyond configured thresholds

- Batch Processing: Handle multiple funds efficiently in parallel

- Idempotency: Ensure scheduler can recover from mid-process failures

- Dry Run Mode: Support simulation without actual trading

- Circuit Breakers: Suspend trading during extreme market volatility
